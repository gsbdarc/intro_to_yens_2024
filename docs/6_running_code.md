## Loading the appropriate software

We use Linux module system to load the software into your current environment. Linux modules are used on research servers
The advantage of the module system is that as a system user you do not need to install the software yourself nor do you need to mess with setting up the paths correctly.
You simply load it and unload it in your current session and the correct paths get added to your environment variables. For software like
Python, R and Julia, etc the user still needs to install their own libraries or packages. We will go over the details of how
to install packages later in this course. Another advantage of the module system is that several versions of the same sofware
can coexist and if your research uses a specific version of software you can stick with it even though the newer versions of that software exist.

### See available software

Check the current list of availaP0+r\ble software and versions on the Yen servers with the following command:


```bash
$ module avail
```

You should see the following:
```bash

  Where:
   g:  built for GPU
   D:  Default Module

Use "module spider" to find all possible modules.
Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching any of the "keys".
```

If you are looking for all available R modules, you can filter `module avail` command as follows:

```bash
$ module avail R/
```

You should see the list of all avaible R versions that are already installed on the Yen server:

```bash
------------------------------------------------ /software/modules/Core -------------------------------------------------
   R/3.6.3    R/4.0.2    R/4.1.3    R/4.2.1 (D)

  Where:
   D:  Default Module

Use "module spider" to find all possible modules.
Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching any of the "keys".
```

{% include tip.html content="If you do not see the software or a particular software version that you need for your research,
please email us with the addition request at [gsb_darcresearch@stanford.edu](mailto:gsb_darcresearch@stanford.edu)." %}

If there are multiple versions of the same sofware, the default version is indicated by a `(D)` next to the module name.
For example, the default R version is currently R/4.2.1 If you are happy with the default version, you can simple type:

```bash
$ module load R
```

and the default version will be loaded. You can also use the shorthand `ml` instead of typing `module load` and `module list`.
If you want to downgrade to an older R version, you
can specify the version number:

```bash
$ ml R/4.1.3
```

To see currently loaded modules, use:

```bash
$ module list
```

Or with a shorthand:
```bash
$ ml
```

You should see:

```bash
Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) rstudio/2022.07.2+576   2) R/4.1.3
```

We see that together with R software, the RStudio module is also loaded automatically.

If you want to switch R versions, you can use:

```bash
$ ml swap R/4.2.1
```

Then, run:
```bash
$ ml
```

You should see:

```bash
Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) rstudio/2022.07.2+576   2) R/4.2.1
```

You can unload an individual module with:

```bash
$ module unload rstudio
```

Or with a shorthand:
```bash
$ ml -rstudio
```
Or you can unload all modules that you have currently loaded with:

```bash
$ ml purge
```

Now, if you run

```bash
$ ml
```

You will see:

```bash
No modules loaded
```

Sometimes you want to know the path where software binary is installed. For example, you might use this information
to install some R packages from source. To get details about a currently loaded package, use:

```bash
$ ml R/4.2.1
$ ml show R
```

This will print the following information that might be useful:

```bash
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   /software/modules/Core/R/4.2.1.lua:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
whatis("Name: R")
whatis("Version: 4.2.1")
whatis("Category: tools")
whatis("URL: http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/")
whatis("Description: R")
family("R")
load("rstudio")
prepend_path("PATH","/software/free/R/R-4.2.1/bin")
```

Linux modules only modify your current working environment which means that if you lose connection to the Yens or close your terminal window,

Once the software you want to use is loaded, the binary is available for you to use from the command line.
For example, if you want to install R packages or run interactive R console, type:

```bash
$ R
```

The interactive R console will open with the R version matching the module you have loaded:

```R
R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23) -- "Funny-Looking Kid"

Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

Type 'q()' to quit R.
```

Type `q()` to exit out of R:

```R
> q()
Save workspace image? [y/n/c]: n
```


## Managing R Software Libraries and Versions
Every R version will also have its own library separate from other versions. For example, R 4.0 will have its user-installed
packages side by side with R 4.2 library containing the user-installed packages specific to that version.

When upgrading your
installed, you can load it in your scripts without the need for repeated installations upon each login.


### Installing R packages without a Graphical Interface
The recommended way to install your R packages is using the command line (not RStudio on JupyterHub and not the terminal in JupyterHub).

### Navigate to Examples Folder
```bash
$ cd rf_bootcamp_2024/examples
$ ls -ltr
```

Load the R module with the version that you want (R 4.2 is the current default).

For example, let's use the newest R version available on the yens:

```bash
$ ml R
```

Start interactive R console by typing `R`.

You should see:

```R
R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23) -- "Funny-Looking Kid"
Copyright (C) 2022 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

Type 'q()' to quit R.

```

Let's install two multiprocessing packages on the yens that we will use for the R example.

```R
> install.packages('foreach')
```
If this is your first time installing R package for this R version on the Yens, you will be asked to create a personal library
(because users do not have write permissions to the system R library). Answer `yes` to both questions:

```R
Warning in install.packages("foreach") :
  'lib = "/software/free/R/R-4.2.1/lib/R/library"' is not writable
Would you like to use a personal library instead? (yes/No/cancel) yes

Would you like to create a personal library
â€˜~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.2â€™
to install packages into? (yes/No/cancel) yes
```
This creates a new personal R 4.2 library in your home directory. The library path is
`~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.2` where all of the user packages will be installed. Once the library is created, next
package will be installed there automatically.

Pick any mirror in the US.

```R
Installing package into â€˜/home/users/nrapstin/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.2â€™
(as â€˜libâ€™ is unspecified)

If the package is successfully installed, you should see:

```R
* DONE (foreach)

The downloaded source packages are in
        â€˜/tmp/RtmpsYpzoP/downloaded_packagesâ€™
```

Then install `doParallel` package:

```R
> install.packages("doParallel")
```

```R
The downloaded source packages are in
        â€˜/tmp/Rtmpwy8WeV/downloaded_packagesâ€™
```
-------------------------
### Running R Script Interactively

Now that we have loaded R module and installed R packages that we are going to use, we are ready to run our code.
You can run R code line by line interactively by copying-and-pasting into the R console.
For example,
[1] "Hello!"
```

The advantage of interactive console is that the results are printed to the screen immediately and if you are developing code
So, use this method for when you need interactive development / debugging environment. Another disadvantage is that if you
did not login with the graphical interface (X forwarding) you will not be able to plot anything in the interactive console.
So, if you need plots and graphs, either use `-Y` flag when connecting to the Yens or use RStudio on JupyterHub.

We can then quit out of R without saving workspace image:

```R
> q()
Save workspace image? [y/n/c]: n
```
-------------------------
Throughout this course, we will explore practical examples that showcase the power of data analytics and research computing.
One such example involves Monte Carlo simulations to calculate Net Present Value (NPV) â€“ a fundamental concept in economics and finance.

## Introducing an R Example


Our Monte Carlo NPV simulation involves the following steps:

1. Randomly generate cash flows over a specified number of periods.
2. Assign a random discount rate to each trial, representing different scenarios.
3. Calculate the NPV for each trial using the generated cash flows and discount rate.
4. Repeat this process for a substantial number of trials (e.g., 50,000) to obtain a distribution of NPV values.
5. Analyze the results to understand the range and characteristics of NPV outcomes.


#### Running Serial R Script on the Command Line
If you want to simply run the script, you can do so from the command line.

{% include warning.html content="Because this R code uses multiprocessing and the yens are a shared computing environment, we need to be careful about how R sees and utilizes the shared cores on the yens."%}


We never use `detectCores()` function on the shared systems, so instead, we will hard code the number of cores for
the script to use in this line in the R script:

```R
ncore <- 1
```

After loading the R module, we can run this script with `Rscript` command on the command line:

```bash
$ Rscript investment-npv-serial.R
```

```bash
Loading required package: iterators
Loading required package: parallel
   user  system elapsed
274.631   0.433 275.130
Parallel NPV Calculation (using 1 cores):
       V1
 Min.   :-727.7947
 1st Qu.: -96.5315
 Median :  -0.0326
 Mean   :  -0.0505
 3rd Qu.:  96.3001
 Max.   : 700.4002
```
Again, running this script is active as long as the session is active (terminal stays open and you do not lose connection).
