## Introduction to the Yens Workshop Goals
- To help you learn to use Stanford GSB’s substantial computing resources
- To help you get comfortable working on *large* social science research projects
    - Use too-big-for-your-laptop, often proprietary datasets, do computationally intensive analyses
    - Tables, figures, and other results generated by thousands of lines of code spread across many files
    - Complex enough to require collaboration between >2 people (including past selves)


We’re assuming you’ve done some programming, but talk to us if you haven’t!

These sessions should be helpful to *you*, so let us know if they aren’t!
