Before we dive into the course content, let's assess your current level of familiarity with the command line shell. Our goal is to ensure everyone gets on the same page, building a solid foundation in basic shell skills while also providing new insights for those already experienced. Since we'll be remotely connecting and using the Yens cluster via the command line, mastering the shell is crucial for conducting research effectively on the Yens. 


### Step 1: What’s your experience level?

- **Beginner**: You’re **new to the shell** or have only explored it a little (e.g., you can open it, but most commands are still unfamiliar).
- **Intermediate**: You have **some hands-on experience** with the shell, and you’re familiar with basic commands like `ls`, `cd`, and `cp`.
- **Advanced**: You feel **confident navigating** the shell, can write simple shell scripts, and use tools like `grep`, `awk`, or `sed`.

Once you've identified your experience level, we’ll split into three groups, each led by an instructor. This way, you’ll get the support that best suits your current skill set, whether you're learning the basics, strengthening core skills, or diving into advanced shell usage.

### Step 2: Find Your Table

#### 1. **Beginner Table**
If you’ve never used a shell or feel unsure about navigating through it:
- Please head over to the [Introduction to the Shell](beginner_shell/1_introduction.md) to get started with the shell basics.

#### 2. **Intermediate and Advanced Groups**
If you’ve used the shell before, let’s make this fun! Try out the following exercise to determine whether you should follow the **intermediate** or **advanced** materials. Do not use the Internet / ChatGPT for this assessment!

#### The Fun Exercise!

Let’s make this more interactive! Follow the steps below and answer the questions within the file you create.

1. In your home directory, create a new directory called `quiz_dir`
2. Navigate into `quiz_dir`
3. Create a new file called `answers.txt` inside `quiz_dir`
4. Now, answer the following questions by writing your answers into `answers.txt`


#### Questions:

1. Which command lists all files, including hidden ones, in the current directory?
2. Which command redirects the output of echo "Hello" into a file called `hello.txt`, overwriting its content?
3. Which command renames the file `hello.txt` to `greeting.txt`?
4. How do you append the text "End of quiz" to the `answers.txt` file?
5. Using the command line, how do you view the contents of `answers.txt` and write the result to another file called `output.txt` at the same time?
