Before we dive into the course content, let's assess your current level of familiarity with the command line shell. Our goal is to ensure everyone gets on the same page, building a solid foundation in basic shell skills while also providing new insights for those already experienced. Since we'll be remotely connecting and using the Yens cluster via the command line, mastering the shell is crucial for conducting research effectively on the Yens. 


### Step 1: What’s your experience level?

- **Beginner**: You’re **new to the shell** or have only explored it a little (e.g., you can open it, but most commands are still unfamiliar).
- **Intermediate**: You have **some hands-on experience** with the shell, and you’re familiar with basic commands like `ls`, `cd`, and `cp`.
- **Advanced**: You feel **confident navigating** the shell, can write simple shell scripts, and use tools like `grep`, `awk`, or `sed`.

Once you've identified your experience level, we’ll split into three groups, each led by an instructor. This way, you’ll get the support that best suits your current skill set, whether you're learning the basics, strengthening core skills, or diving into advanced shell usage.
